// This file is DEPRECATED and no longer needed
// Replaced by CallManager's built-in incoming call dialog
// The CallManager now handles incoming calls with its own dialog implementation
// in the _buildIncomingCallDialog method

// Original IncomingCallScreen functionality has been moved to:
// - CallManager._buildIncomingCallDialog() for UI
// - CallManager._handleIncomingCall() for logic
